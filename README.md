# Training binary neural networks with real-to-binary convolutions


#### Code release
Code is still coming, but it will have to wait a bit longer than I expected. Sorry for the inconvenience.

In the meantime, the guys at [plumerai](https://www.plumerai.com/) have re-implemented our work: [Network architecture](https://github.com/larq/zoo/blob/master/larq_zoo/literature/real_to_bin_nets.py)
and [Training code](https://github.com/larq/zoo/blob/master/larq_zoo/training/multi_stage_experiments.py)

And if you are interested in binary CNNs in general, we really recommend that you check [larq](https://larq.dev/).
